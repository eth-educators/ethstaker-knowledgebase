# Block proposal frequency

## It's random

How often a validator receives block proposals, and is selected to be part of a [sync committee](../staking-glossary.md#sync-committee), is entirely random. As long as you do not see missed proposals, there is absolutely nothing you can do to increase the frequency.

True randomness can feel quite odd. A validator not getting a proposal for 9 months is perfectly normal. A validator getting two proposals in a week is entirely normal. Over a large enough set, this evens out, but for a handful of validators, randomness can indeed feel unsettling.

To see the latest's statistics on block proposal frequency take a look at [Lucky Staker ↗](https://luckystaker.com/home).

The tool [ethdo ↗](https://github.com/wealdtech/ethdo) by [attestant.io ↗](https://www.attestant.io) can be used to query the current average frequency of proposals and sync committees.

As of early 2024, it is roughly one proposal every 4 months and sync committee participation every 5 years.

## Is there really nothing I can do?!?

No, it's random. There is nothing you can do to increase your chances at proposals, short of running more validators.
