## Why run an Ethereum full node?

🍎 Contribute to the health of the Ethereum network.

* Check all transactions on the network are valid for yourself.
* Don't trust, verify.

📡 Broadcast your transactions [through your own node](../tutorials/rpc-endpoint.md).

* Remove reliance on 3rd parties and intermediaries such as Infura or Alchemy.
* Increase censorship resistance through decentralization.

Running a full node has very similar hardware requirements to running a validating node. The only difference is that validating nodes [propose blocks](../staking-glossary.md#block-proposer).

If you follow any of the [solo staking guides](../tutorials/solo-staking-guides.md) and complete all the steps apart from the deposit process (which requires 32 ETH) then you will be running a full node!
