It's critically important for the health and long term sustainability of Ethereum that there is a diverse and balanced client ecosystem. Multiple, independently developed and maintained clients exist because client diversity makes the network more resilient to attacks and bugs. Multiple clients is a strength unique to Ethereum - other blockchains rely on the infallibility of a single client. However, it is not enough simply to have multiple, clients available, they have to be adopted by the community and the total active nodes distributed relatively evenly across them.

Please consider running a minority client to support Ethereum.
