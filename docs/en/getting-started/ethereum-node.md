# Running a node without any ETH

!!! info "Info"

    No ETH is required to run a full node! ü•≥


## Why run an Ethereum full node?

üçé Contribute to the health of the Ethereum network.

* Check all transactions on the network are valid for yourself.
* Don't trust, verify.

üì° Broadcast your transactions [through your own node](../../tutorials/rpc-endpoint).

* Remove reliance on 3rd parties and intermediaries such as Infura or Alchemy.
* Increase censorship resistance through decentralization.

Running a full node has very similar hardware requirements to running a validating node. The only difference is that validating nodes [propose blocks](../../staking-glossary#block-proposer).

If you follow any of the [solo staking guides](../../tutorials/solo-staking-guides) and complete all the steps apart from the deposit process (which requires 32 ETH) then you will be running a full node!
