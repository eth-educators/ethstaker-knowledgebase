# Setting up Tailscale VPN

{% hint style="info" %}
This is optional. You only need to consider this section if you run a node at home and would like to connect to it from outside of your home network.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Tailscale requires the use of an SSO identity provider, ensure you are aware of and are comfortable with the additional risks associated with this before proceeding. For details, visit [their SSO Page ↗](https://tailscale.com/kb/1013/sso-providers/).
{% endhint %}

If you would like to log into your home network remotely, such as while on vacation or on a business trip, the most common route is to use a **Virtual Private Network** server. This will allow you to connect to your node via SSH **and** view your monitoring dashboards from anywhere in the world, all without exposing your SSH port to the internet.

Many node operators use [Tailscale ↗](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/) as their VPN server of choice for this. Tailscale is an open-source P2P VPN tunnel and hosted endpoint discovery service. It takes care of authentication, publication, and the NAT traversal required to establish an end-to-end encrypted path between your machine and your node without sending any sensitive traffic to a centralized server. It is a very powerful tool.

We will briefly cover a basic configuration of it, but feel free to [review their documentation ↗](https://tailscale.com/kb/start/) for more details.

## Setting Tailscale Up

First, create a free [Tailscale account ↗](https://tailscale.com/). Tailscale requires the use of an SSO identity provider such as Google, GitHub, Okta, Microsoft, etc. For details, visit [their SSO Page ↗](https://tailscale.com/kb/1013/sso-providers/).

It is recommended that you enable 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) on whichever identity provider you choose for added security.

Next, follow [their onboarding guide ↗](https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install/) to install Tailscale on your **client** - the machine you want to connect to your network with. For example, this could be a laptop or your phone. **Note that it is **_**not**_** your validator node!**

Once completed you should see your computer as 'connected' on the [**Tailscale dashboard ↗**](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines).

Now, [install Tailscale on your **node** ↗](https://tailscale.com/kb/1039/install-ubuntu-2004/). First, add Tailscale’s package signing key and repository **on your node**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/focal.noarmor.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/tailscale-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/focal.tailscale-keyring.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list
```

Now, install Tailscale **on your node**:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tailscale
```

Finally, authenticate and connect your machine to your Tailscale network **on your node**:

```bash
sudo tailscale up
```

You’re connected! You can find your Tailscale IPv4 address by running:

```bash
tailscale ip -4
```

You should now see your node machine added to the [**Tailscale dashboard ↗**](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines). You may also **change the name** of the node machine and **disable key expiry** through the dashboard.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you would like to access your node using its name rather than its IP address, you can do so by enabling [MagicDNS ↗](https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns/) in the Tailscale settings.
{% endhint %}

You should now be able to `exit` the SSH session to your node on your client, and SSH into your node again through Tailscale using `ssh <user>@<node-name> -p <ssh-port>`.

### Updating UFW

If you have UFW configured, you can now add a rule to [accept any incoming SSH connections over Tailscale ↗](https://tailscale.com/kb/1077/secure-server-ubuntu-18-04/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following steps will modify your firewall rules. **You must have at least 2 SSH sessions open to your node machine before proceeding** - one for modifying the configuration and testing it afterward, and one that will stay logged in as a backup in case your changes break SSH so you can revert them!
{% endhint %}

**Run these commands on the node machine.**

Allow access to all incoming ssh connections over Tailscale.

```bash
sudo ufw allow in on tailscale0
```

You may also remove access to the SSH port to completely lock down your node. Note that you **will not** be able to log in from the local network as Tailscale will become the only way to log in. Only run the following command if you are okay with this.

```bash
sudo ufw delete "22/tcp"
```

Once you’ve set up firewall rules to restrict all non-Tailscale connections, restart UFW and SSH:

```bash
sudo ufw reload
sudo service ssh restart
```

Now, confirm that everything is working as expected. `exit` from one of your current SSH sessions (**but remember to keep the second one open as a backup**). Next, connect to the **node machine** via SSH using the Tailscale IP address or hostname: `ssh <user>@<node-name> -p <ssh-port>`

If it works, you did everything right and can now safely log into your home network while abroad!

{% hint style="info" %}
If you've previously port-forwarded your node's SSH port in your router, you can now remove it.
