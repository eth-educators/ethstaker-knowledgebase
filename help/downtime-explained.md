# I'm worried about downtime 😔

You shouldn't worry about downtime, but understanding what happens when your validator is offline can help you to gain confidence as a solo home staker.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Ethereum network is designed with solo home stakers in mind. This means that the protocol is very forgiving if a validator has downtime or is offline.

If a validator is offline and not executing its duties, it will be penalized at a rate slightly lower than the rewards for the same period of time.
{% endhint %}

## Example Scenario

* You start your solo staking home validator with 32 ETH.
* Everything is going well and after a few months, your validator balance is 32.5 ETH.
* Then... your validator goes offline! 🚨
  * If this happens for real, check out the "[My validator is offline! What do I do?](validator-offline.md)" guide.

### Inactivity Leak

* As soon as your validator is no longer participating in the network it will start [leaking](../staking-glossary.md#inactivity-leak) ETH.
  * When you are offline, for each missed attestation the inactivity leak might be around -0.000011 ETH (the inactivity leak is slightly less than a successful attestation).
  * For a normal successful attestation, you might be rewarded with 0.000014 ETH.
* If you have a catastrophic failure and you are not able to get your validator back online for 5 days, then it will take about 5 days of being back online to get back to the same balance as when the failure occurred.

### Missed Block Proposals

If you are offline, you will not be able to produce a block. But how often do block proposals occur for a single validator? Currently, on average, a validator will propose a block every 2-3 months.

So, in this example scenario, even if you are offline for 5 days, there's only a small chance you would miss a block proposal. But what happens if you miss a block proposal?

If you miss your block proposal, the [slot](https://github.com/Buttaa/ethstaker/blob/main/help/staking-glossary.md#slot) that should have contained your block will be empty. Other than the lost [rewards](https://github.com/Buttaa/ethstaker/blob/main/help/rewards/chain-rewards.md) from missing the block proposal, there are **no penalties or slashing** that occurs from a missed block proposal.

### Can I be slashed for being offline?

No. Realistically, the only condition that can cause a [slashing event](https://github.com/Buttaa/ethstaker/blob/main/help/staking-glossary.md#slashable-offenses) is if you run your validator's keys on two nodes at the same time (such as a failover / redundancy setup, where your backup node accidentally turns on while your main node is still running). Don't let this happen, and you won't get slashed. **Slashing cannot occur from being offline for maintenance**.

## What if I can't recover my validator and/or I want to stop staking?

If you can't recover your validator or decide you want to stop staking, you have the option to exit your validator from the network. Exiting a validator is a one-way process. For details on how to exit your validator, [check out our guide](../tutorials/how-to-exit-a-validator.md).

## Conclusion

Being a solo validator is an important responsibility to ensure the long-term health of the Ethereum network. At EthStaker our goal is to help as many people as possible [#stakefromhome ↗](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stakefromhome) and this information is provided to show that downtime and being offline is not something to be overly worried about.
